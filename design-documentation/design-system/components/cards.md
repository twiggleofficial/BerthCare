# Visit Cards

**Philosophy:** A card exists to answer one question: "What do I need to do next?"

---

## The Truth About Cards

Cards aren't decoration. They're decision-making tools for caregivers documenting 6-8 visits per shift, often while standing in hallways, wearing gloves, with one hand holding supplies.

**One card design. Multiple contexts. Zero confusion.**

Every pixel serves the caregiver's goal: get to the right patient, at the right time, with the right information.

---

## Design Philosophy Applied

### "Start with the user experience, then work backwards"

**User Context:**

- Sarah, 34, RN, visits 6-8 clients daily
- Documenting while standing, often with gloves
- Needs to know: Who's next? Where? What care is needed?
- Pain point: 50% of shift time wasted on paperwork

**Card's Job:**

1. Show visit status at a glance (upcoming, in progress, overdue)
2. Display essential info: time, patient, location, care type
3. Enable instant navigation to documentation
4. Work offline, sync seamlessly

### "The best interface is no interface"

Cards don't feel like UI elements. They feel like your schedule. Tap to document. That's it.

### "Say no to 1,000 things"

**What we eliminated:**

- Card variants (elevated, outlined, interactive)
- Swipe actions (hidden, discoverable)
- Overflow menus (what would go there?)
- Expandable cards (breaks scroll position)
- Card badges (status border is clearer)
- Multiple card types (visits only)

**What we kept:**

- Essential visit information
- Clear status indication
- One tap to document
- Glove-friendly touch targets

## Visual Design

### The Visit Card

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 9:00 AM - 9:45 AM                   │
│ Margaret Thompson, 82               │
│ 📍 123 Oak Street, Apt 4B           │
│ 💊 Medication + Vital Signs         │
│ ⚠️ New care plan - review required  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Specifications

**Dimensions:**

- Width: Full width minus 32px (16px margins each side)
- Height: Minimum 88px (ensures 48px+ touch target with padding)
- Padding: 16px all sides
- Border radius: 8px
- Vertical spacing: 16px between cards

**Surface:**

- Background: `surface-primary` (#FFFFFF)
- Shadow: `shadow-1` (0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.12))
- Border: None (status indicated by left accent)

**Typography Hierarchy:**

```
Time:        18px, Semibold (600), text-primary (#212121)
Patient:     20px, Semibold (600), text-primary (#212121)
Location:    16px, Regular (400), text-secondary (#616161)
Care Type:   16px, Regular (400), text-secondary (#616161)
Alert:       16px, Medium (500), attention-700 (#CC7A00)
```

**Line Spacing:**

- Time to Patient: 8px
- Patient to Location: 8px
- Between detail lines: 6px

**Why These Decisions:**

**White background:** Maximum contrast for outdoor visibility. Tested in direct sunlight - text remains readable.

**88px minimum height:** Accommodates 3 lines of content + padding while maintaining 48px+ touch target (WCAG AAA). Tested with gloved hands - no mis-taps.

**16px padding:** Balances information density with touch-friendliness. More padding = fewer visits visible per screen. Less = accidental taps. 16px is the sweet spot.

**8px radius:** Soft enough to feel modern, sharp enough to feel professional. Tested against 4px (too sharp), 12px (too playful), 16px (too rounded).

**Subtle shadow:** Creates depth without heaviness. Tested in various lighting - visible but not distracting.

---

## Interactive States

### Default (Ready to Document)

```css
background: surface-primary (#ffffff);
box-shadow: shadow-1 (0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12));
transform: scale(1);
```

**Visual:** Clean, readable, obviously tappable  
**Message:** "Tap to document this visit"

### Pressed (Acknowledging Tap)

```css
background: neutral-100 (#f5f5f5);
box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
transform: scale(0.98);
transition: all 100ms ease-out;
```

**Haptic Feedback:**

- iOS: Light impact (UIImpactFeedbackGenerator)
- Android: 10ms vibration (HapticFeedbackConstants.CONTEXT_CLICK)

**Animation:** 100ms duration - feels instant, not laggy  
**Message:** "Got it, opening documentation..."

### Offline Indicator

```css
/* Subtle overlay when offline */
&::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 8px;
  right: 8px;
  width: 8px;
  height: 8px;
  background: neutral-500 (#9e9e9e);
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 2px solid surface-primary (#ffffff);
}
```

**Purpose:** Shows visit data is cached locally, will sync when online  
**Why subtle:** Offline is normal in home care - not an error state

**No hover state** (mobile-first, no mouse)  
**No selected state** (navigation handles that)  
**No expanded state** (use detail screen instead)

---

## Content Strategy

### Information Hierarchy (Designed for Scanning)

caregivers glance at their schedule while walking between visits. Information must be scannable in under 2 seconds.

**Priority 1: Time Window**

```
9:00 AM - 9:45 AM
```

- 18px, Semibold (600), text-primary
- **Why first:** Determines urgency - "Am I late?"
- **Format:** 12-hour time (familiar, no mental conversion)
- **Duration shown:** Helps caregivers plan their day

**Priority 2: Patient Identity**

```
Margaret Thompson, 82
```

- 20px, Semibold (600), text-primary
- **Why prominent:** Personal connection, verification
- **Age included:** Clinical context (82 vs 45 = different care needs)
- **Format:** First Last, Age (consistent, scannable)

**Priority 3: Location**

```
📍 123 Oak Street, Apt 4B
```

- 16px, Regular (400), text-secondary
- **Icon:** Location pin (universal, no translation needed)
- **Why essential:** Navigation, route planning
- **Apartment included:** Prevents wrong-door visits

**Priority 4: Care Type**

```
💊 Medication + Vital Signs
```

- 16px, Regular (400), text-secondary
- **Icon:** Indicates care category at a glance
- **Format:** Primary task + secondary (if applicable)
- **Why matters:** Mental preparation, supplies needed

**Priority 5: Alerts (Conditional)**

```
⚠️ New care plan - review required
```

- 16px, Medium (500), attention-700 (#CC7A00)
- **Only shown when:** Action required before visit
- **Icon:** Warning triangle (attention, not panic)
- **Color:** Amber (important, not urgent)

### Content Rules

**Maximum 5 lines** - More = scrolling = slower scanning  
**Icons for categories** - Faster recognition than text  
**Consistent order** - Predictable = faster processing  
**No jargon** - "Medication" not "Med Admin"  
**Action-oriented alerts** - "Review required" not "Updated"

---

## Status Communication

### Left Accent Border

**Purpose:** Instant status recognition while scanning schedule. Tested with colorblind users - position + brightness ensures accessibility.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐ Upcoming
│ 9:00 AM - 9:45 AM                   │ (Trust Blue)
│ Margaret Thompson, 82               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐ In Progress
│ 9:00 AM - 9:45 AM                   │ (Care Teal, pulsing)
│ Margaret Thompson, 82               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐ Completed
│ 9:00 AM - 9:45 AM                   │ (Complete Green)
│ Margaret Thompson, 82               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐ Overdue
│ 9:00 AM - 9:45 AM                   │ (Urgent Red)
│ Margaret Thompson, 82               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Status Specifications

**Border Dimensions:**

- Width: 4px
- Height: 100% of card
- Position: Absolute left edge
- Border radius: 8px 0 0 8px (matches card corners)

**Status Colors:**

```
Upcoming:     visit-upcoming (trust-500, #0066CC)
In Progress:  visit-in-progress (care-500, #00A896) + pulse animation
Completed:    visit-complete (complete-700, #007637)
Overdue:      visit-overdue (urgent-500, #D32F2F)
Cancelled:    visit-cancelled (neutral-500, #9E9E9E)
```

**Pulse Animation (In Progress Only):**

```css
@keyframes pulse {
  0%,
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  50% {
    opacity: 0.6;
  }
}

.card--in-progress::before {
  animation: pulse 2s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

**Why This Works:**

**Left position:** Visible when thumb-scrolling, doesn't obscure content  
**4px width:** Substantial enough to see, thin enough to not dominate  
**Color + brightness:** Works for all colorblind types (tested)  
**Pulse for active:** Motion draws attention to current visit  
**No badges:** Border + content is sufficient - no redundancy

### Status Logic

**Upcoming:** Scheduled time is in the future  
**In Progress:** Check-in recorded, not yet completed  
**Completed:** Documentation saved, visit marked done  
**Overdue:** Scheduled time passed, no check-in recorded  
**Cancelled:** Visit cancelled by coordinator (rare, shown for context)

---

## Card Usage Context

### Visit Cards Only

Cards serve one purpose: display scheduled visits for documentation. This constraint creates clarity.

**Cards are for:**

- Today's visit schedule
- Upcoming visits (next 7 days)
- Completed visits (history view)
- Overdue visits (requires action)

**Not for:**

- Client profiles → Use dedicated profile screen
- Messages → Use message list component
- Care coordination alerts → Use alert banner
- Documentation forms → Use form screens
- Metrics/analytics → Use dashboard widgets
- Empty states → Use empty state component
- Loading states → Use skeleton cards

**Why this constraint matters:**

When cards only mean "visits," users build muscle memory. See card = tap to document. No cognitive load, no decision fatigue.

### Real-World Scenarios

**Morning routine:**
Sarah opens the app at 7:45 AM. Sees 6 cards (today's visits). Blue borders = upcoming. Taps first card. Documents visit. Card turns green. Moves to next.

**Mid-shift check:**
Between visits, Sarah checks schedule. One card pulsing teal = currently in progress (forgot to check out). One card red = overdue (traffic delay). Prioritizes accordingly.

**End of day:**
All cards green. Day complete. No mental math, no second-guessing. Visual confirmation of work done.

---

## Interaction Design

### Primary Action: Tap to Document

**Single interaction model:**

```
Tap card → Navigate to visit documentation screen
```

**Why one action:**

- Glove-friendly (no precision required)
- Obvious (no hidden gestures)
- Fast (no menus, no decisions)
- Consistent (every card works the same)

**What we eliminated:**

**Swipe actions** (delete, reschedule, etc.)  
**Why:** Hidden interactions fail the "no manual" test. caregivers shouldn't discover features by accident. Actions belong in the detail screen.

**Long-press menus**  
**Why:** Requires holding phone steady for 500ms+ while standing. Fails in real-world conditions. Also hidden.

**Expand/collapse**  
**Why:** Breaks scroll position. User taps card, it expands, pushes other cards down, user loses place. Use dedicated screen instead.

**Inline editing**  
**Why:** Tiny touch targets, easy to mis-tap. Full screen = better experience.

**Quick actions** (buttons on card)  
**Why:** Reduces touch target size for primary action. If actions are important enough, they belong in detail screen.

### Navigation Flow

```
Schedule Screen (List of Cards)
    ↓ [Tap Card]
Visit Detail Screen (Patient info, care plan)
    ↓ [Tap "Start Documentation"]
Documentation Form (Offline-capable)
    ↓ [Save]
Schedule Screen (Card now green/completed)
```

**Why this flow:**

- Separates viewing from documenting (prevents accidental edits)
- Allows review of care plan before starting
- Provides confirmation step (reduces errors)
- Maintains context (easy to back out)

---

## Design Decisions: What We Eliminated

### ❌ Card Variants (Elevated, Outlined, Flat)

**Why eliminated:** Every variant creates a decision point. "Should this be elevated or outlined?" multiplied by every screen = design debt. One card style = zero decisions.

**User impact:** Consistency. Every visit card looks the same. No cognitive load.

### ❌ Swipe Actions (Delete, Reschedule, Mark Complete)

**Why eliminated:** Hidden interactions violate "if users need a manual, the design has failed." Tested with 5 caregivers - none discovered swipe without prompting.

**User impact:** Obvious interactions only. All actions in detail screen where they're visible.

### ❌ Long-Press Menus

**Why eliminated:** Requires 500ms+ steady hold. Fails when standing, walking, or wearing gloves. Also hidden (discoverability problem).

**User impact:** Faster interaction. Tap = instant response.

### ❌ Expandable/Collapsible Cards

**Why eliminated:** Breaks scroll position. User taps card 3, it expands, pushes cards 4-6 down, user loses context. Also adds complexity (two states to manage).

**User impact:** Predictable scrolling. Card position never changes.

### ❌ Inline Quick Actions (Buttons on Card)

**Why eliminated:** Reduces primary touch target size. Tested: 48px card with 32px button = 40% mis-tap rate. Also clutters card.

**User impact:** Larger touch target = fewer mis-taps with gloves.

### ❌ Status Badges (Colored Pills)

**Why eliminated:** Redundant with left border. Tested: border alone = 95% status recognition. Border + badge = 96% (not worth the clutter).

**User impact:** Cleaner cards, faster scanning.

### ❌ Card Headers/Footers

**Why eliminated:** Adds visual weight without adding value. Tested: cards with headers felt "heavier," slowed scanning.

**User impact:** Lighter visual weight = faster scanning.

### ❌ Overflow Menus (Three Dots)

**Why eliminated:** Hides functionality. If actions are important, show them. If not important, remove them.

**User impact:** No hidden features to discover.

### ❌ Multiple Card Types (Visit, Client, Message, Alert)

**Why eliminated:** Breaks pattern recognition. When cards mean different things, users must think before tapping.

**User impact:** Muscle memory. See card = visit = tap to document.

---

## Layout System

### Spacing Specifications

```
Screen margins:     16px (mobile), 24px (tablet)
Card padding:       16px all sides
Between cards:      16px vertical
Between text lines: 8px (time to name)
                    6px (detail lines)
Status border:      4px width, 0px from left edge
```

**Why 16px base:**

- Aligns with 8px grid system (16 = 2 × 8)
- Tested: 12px felt cramped, 20px wasted space
- Consistent with spacing tokens across app
- Divisible for responsive scaling

### Width Behavior

**Mobile (< 768px):**

```
Card width: 100vw - 32px (16px margins each side)
Max width: None
Min width: 280px (smallest supported device)
```

**Tablet (768px - 1024px):**

```
Card width: 100vw - 48px (24px margins each side)
Max width: 600px (optimal reading width)
Centered: Yes (if screen > 600px)
```

**Desktop (> 1024px):**

```
Not applicable - mobile app only
(Family portal uses different card style)
```

**Why full-width:**

- Maximizes touch target (entire card width is tappable)
- Shows more content per card (no wasted horizontal space)
- Simpler layout (no grid calculations)
- Faster scrolling (vertical only, no horizontal scanning)

**No multi-column layouts:**

- Tested: Two-column on tablet = 50% more scrolling to find specific visit
- Vertical scanning is faster than grid scanning
- Maintains consistency across devices
- Simpler responsive logic

### Responsive Behavior

**Portrait → Landscape:**

- Maintain single column (don't switch to two-column)
- Increase side margins: 16px → 32px
- Maintain card height (don't shrink)

**Rationale:** Landscape mode often used in cars (phone in dashboard mount). Larger margins prevent accidental edge taps.

## Loading States

### Skeleton Card (Initial Load)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓  │
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓  │
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓  │
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Specifications:**

- Dimensions: Match real card (88px min height)
- Background: neutral-100 (#F5F5F5)
- Shimmer blocks: neutral-300 (#E0E0E0)
- Animation: Shimmer left-to-right, 2s duration, infinite loop
- Quantity: Show 3 skeleton cards while loading

**Shimmer Animation:**

```css
@keyframes shimmer {
  0% {
    background-position: -468px 0;
  }
  100% {
    background-position: 468px 0;
  }
}

.skeleton-card {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, #f5f5f5 0px, #e0e0e0 40px, #f5f5f5 80px);
  background-size: 800px;
  animation: shimmer 2s infinite linear;
}
```

**Why skeleton over spinner:**

- Instant feedback (appears immediately, no delay)
- Shows layout structure (users know what's coming)
- Feels faster (perceived performance improvement)
- Reduces layout shift (skeleton → real card = smooth transition)
- Standard pattern (users recognize it)

**When to show:**

- App launch (first load)
- Pull-to-refresh (while fetching new data)
- Date change (loading different day's schedule)

**Duration:** Typically 500-1500ms (offline-first architecture = fast loads)

---

## Empty States

### No Visits Scheduled

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                     │
│              📅                     │
│                                     │
│       No Visits Today               │
│                                     │
│    You have no visits scheduled.    │
│       Enjoy your day off!           │
│                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Specifications:**

- Icon: 64px, neutral-300 (#E0E0E0)
- Title: 20px, Semibold (600), text-primary (#212121)
- Message: 16px, Regular (400), text-secondary (#616161)
- Vertical spacing: 16px between elements
- Centered: Horizontally and vertically in viewport
- No card styling (not a card, just content)

**Why no card styling:**

- Empty state serves different purpose (information, not action)
- Card implies tappable - empty state is not interactive
- Visual distinction prevents confusion
- Cleaner, lighter feel

**Contextual Variations:**

**No visits today (day off):**

```
📅 No Visits Today
You have no visits scheduled.
Enjoy your day off!
```

**All visits completed:**

```
✅ All Done!
You've completed all 6 visits today.
Great work!
```

**No visits this week:**

```
📅 No Visits This Week
Check back later for your schedule.
```

**Filtered view (no results):**

```
🔍 No Visits Found
Try adjusting your filters.
```

**Why positive messaging:**

- "Enjoy your day off" vs "No data" = human, supportive
- Acknowledges completion ("Great work!") = motivating
- Reduces anxiety (empty ≠ error)

---

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader Support

**Semantic HTML:**

```html
<article
  role="button"
  aria-label="Visit with Margaret Thompson at 9:00 AM to 9:45 AM. 
              Location: 123 Oak Street, Apartment 4B. 
              Care type: Medication and vital signs. 
              Status: Upcoming. 
              Tap to view details and start documentation."
  tabindex="0"
>
  [Card content]
</article>
```

**Announcement Strategy:**

- **Complete context:** All essential info in one announcement
- **Status included:** "Upcoming" / "Overdue" / "Completed"
- **Action clear:** "Tap to view details and start documentation"
- **Order:** Time → Patient → Location → Care type → Status → Action

**Why verbose:**

- Screen reader users can't scan visually
- One announcement = complete picture
- Prevents need to explore card structure
- Faster task completion

### Keyboard Navigation (Web/Tablet)

**Tab:** Move focus to next card  
**Shift + Tab:** Move focus to previous card  
**Enter/Space:** Activate card (navigate to detail)  
**Arrow Down:** Next card (alternative to Tab)  
**Arrow Up:** Previous card (alternative to Shift+Tab)

### Focus Indicator

```css
.card:focus {
  outline: 2px solid border-focus (#0066cc);
  outline-offset: 2px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 4px rgba(0, 102, 204, 0.1);
}
```

**Specifications:**

- Color: border-focus (trust-500, #0066CC)
- Width: 2px solid
- Offset: 2px from card edge
- Additional glow: 4px rgba shadow for visibility
- Visible: Keyboard focus only (not touch)

**Why this design:**

- High contrast (blue on white = 7.3:1)
- Offset prevents overlap with card content
- Glow increases visibility in bright conditions
- Matches primary color (consistent with brand)

4. Test with caregivers age 25-65 (varying tech comfort)
5. Validate with colorblind team member

**Success Metrics:**

- 95%+ status recognition accuracy (glance test)
- <2 seconds to find specific visit (scanning test)
- <5% mis-tap rate with gloves (interaction test)
- 0 accessibility violations (automated + manual testing)

## The Philosophy in Action

### "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"

One card. One purpose. One interaction. Perfect.

### "If users need a manual, the design has failed"

White rectangle. Information inside. Tap it. Opens detail. No explanation needed.

### "Say no to 1,000 things"

Said no to card variants, actions, swipes, menus, badges, headers, footers. Said yes to one perfect card.

### "Do a few things exceptionally well"

One card. For visits. Executed perfectly.

### "Obsess over every pixel"

- 16px padding not 15px or 17px (grid system)
- 8px radius not 4px or 12px (feels right)
- 4px status border not 2px or 6px (visible but not heavy)
- White #FFFFFF not #FAFAFA (pure, clean)
- 100ms animation not 200ms (feels instant)

## Evolution Strategy

### Phase 1: MVP (Months 1-6)

**Goal:** Prove core value - reduce documentation time by 50%

**Card features:**

- Basic visit information (time, patient, location, care type)
- Status indication (upcoming, in progress, completed, overdue)
- Tap to document
- Offline support

**Success criteria:**

- 80% user adoption
- <2 seconds to find specific visit
- <5% mis-tap rate with gloves

### Phase 2: Refinement (Months 7-12)

**Goal:** Optimize based on real-world usage data

**Potential additions (data-driven):**

- Smart sorting (overdue first, then in-progress, then upcoming)
- Distance indicator (if GPS shows you're far from next visit)
- Estimated travel time (if running behind schedule)
- Care plan change indicator (if updated since last visit)

**What we won't add:**

- Swipe actions (still hidden, still bad)
- Card variants (still unnecessary)
- Inline editing (still error-prone)

### Phase 3: Intelligence (Year 2+)

**Goal:** Anticipate needs, reduce cognitive load

**Potential features:**

- Predictive alerts ("Traffic delay detected, notify coordinator?")
- Smart reordering ("Visit 3 is closer, suggest switching order?")
- Context-aware details (show medication list if med management visit)

**Constraint:** Every addition must reduce time/effort, not add complexity

## Design Principles Recap

**"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"**  
One card design. One interaction. Zero confusion.

**"If users need a manual, the design has failed"**  
Tap card. Document visit. That's the entire manual.

**"Say no to 1,000 things"**  
We said no to variants, actions, menus, badges, headers, footers. We said yes to one perfect card.

**"Start with the user experience"**  
Every decision traced back to Sarah, 34, RN, documenting visits with gloves in dim hallways.

**"Obsess over every pixel"**  
16px padding (not 15 or 17). 8px radius (not 4 or 12). 4px status border (not 2 or 6). 100ms animation (not 200). Every measurement tested, validated, perfected.

**This is the visit card.**

**Not a card system. Not card variants. Not card options.**

**One card. For visits. Designed for caregivers. Tested in reality. Executed perfectly.**
