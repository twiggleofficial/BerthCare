# BerthCare Design System Documentation

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** October 6, 2025  
**Design Philosophy:** Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication

---

## Overview

This design system transforms BerthCare's product vision into an intuitive, beautiful mobile-first experience that eliminates friction for home care workers. Every design decision prioritizes the user's reality: working in challenging environments, wearing gloves, managing time pressure, and caring for vulnerable people.

**Core Principle:** If users need a manual, the design has failed.

## Design Philosophy Applied to BerthCare

### Simplicity Over Features

- **Eliminate unnecessary complexity:** Each screen serves one primary purpose
- **Progressive disclosure:** Advanced features hidden until needed
- **Obvious interactions:** No hidden gestures or unclear affordances

### User Experience First

- **Start with the caregiver's reality:** Gloves, poor lighting, time pressure, emotional labor
- **Work backwards to technology:** Offline-first isn't a feature, it's a requirement
- **Make documentation feel effortless:** The best interface disappears

### Obsess Over Details

- **Touch targets:** Minimum 48px for gloved hands
- **Contrast ratios:** Readable in bright sunlight and dim homes
- **Loading states:** Every action has immediate feedback
- **Error prevention:** Design to prevent mistakes, not just handle them

### Question Everything

- Why does this button exist?
- Can we eliminate this step entirely?
- What if the user never sees this screen?
- How would a 10-year-old understand this?

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Mobile-First, Offline-First

**Decision:** Design for the worst-case scenario (rural basement, no signal, dying battery)  
**Rationale:** If it works there, it works everywhere  
**Impact:** Every interaction must work without network; sync is invisible background process

### 2. One-Handed Operation

**Decision:** All primary actions accessible with thumb on 6.1" screen  
**Rationale:** caregivers carry supplies, open doors, steady patients  
**Impact:** Bottom navigation, large touch targets, no top-corner actions

### 3. Glanceable Information

**Decision:** Critical info visible in <1 second without scrolling  
**Rationale:** Quick reference during care delivery  
**Impact:** Card-based layouts, bold typography, color-coded status

### 4. Voice-First Input Option

**Decision:** Every text field supports voice-to-text  
**Rationale:** Faster than typing, works with gloves  
**Impact:** Microphone icon on all inputs, smart punctuation

### 5. Undo Over Confirm

**Decision:** Allow actions immediately, provide easy undo  
**Rationale:** Confirmation dialogs slow workflow  
**Impact:** Floating undo snackbar, 5-second window for reversal

## Design Principles for Each Feature

### Visit Documentation

**Principle:** Make the common case instant, the complex case possible  
**Application:** 80% of visits use quick-tap templates; 20% have full form access

### Smart Data Reuse

**Principle:** Show what changed, hide what didn't  
**Application:** Copied data appears muted; edited fields highlighted

### Care Coordination

**Principle:** Urgency determines visibility  
**Application:** Critical alerts interrupt; routine updates queue silently

### Family Portal

**Principle:** Transparency without overwhelming  
**Application:** Show outcomes, not medical jargon; one-page summaries

---

## Success Metrics for Design

### Usability Targets

- **Time to first visit documentation:** <30 seconds from app open
- **Documentation completion time:** <10 minutes per visit
- **Error rate:** <2% requiring correction
- **Training time:** <2 hours to proficiency

### Satisfaction Targets

- **System Usability Scale (SUS):** >80 (excellent)
- **Net Promoter Score:** >50
- **Task completion rate:** >95%
- **User preference:** >75% prefer to paper/desktop

## Next Steps for Developers

1. **Read the style guide** (`design-system/style-guide.md`) for foundational elements
2. **Review component specifications** for implementation details
3. **Study feature flows** for user journey understanding
4. **Reference platform adaptations** for iOS/Android specifics
5. **Validate accessibility** against WCAG checklist
