# Authentication & Onboarding

> **Design Philosophy**: If users need a manual, the design has failed. This authentication experience eliminates unnecessary complexity and makes getting started feel magical.

## Overview

BerthCare's authentication and onboarding experience is designed to get home care caregivers documenting visits within 60 seconds of first launch. We've eliminated traditional multi-step registration flows in favor of a streamlined, role-aware system that recognizes users are often starting their shift and need immediate access.

**Core Principle**: The best interface is no interface. Authentication should be invisible, onboarding should be instant, and users should feel productive from moment one.

---

## User Experience Strategy

### Primary User Goals

1. **Get to work immediately** - No lengthy setup processes blocking access to patient documentation
2. **Feel confident using the app** - Intuitive design that requires zero training
3. **Trust the security** - Biometric authentication that feels both secure and effortless
4. **Understand their role** - Clear context about what they can do and why

### Design Decisions

#### What We're Eliminating

- ❌ Traditional username/password creation flows
- ❌ Multi-screen registration wizards
- ❌ Email verification delays
- ❌ Lengthy terms of service screens
- ❌ Tutorial carousels that users skip
- ❌ Unnecessary profile setup steps

#### What We're Embracing

- ✓ Pre-provisioned accounts (admin creates, user activates)
- ✓ Biometric-first authentication (Face ID/Touch ID/fingerprint)
- ✓ Contextual just-in-time guidance
- ✓ Progressive disclosure of features
- ✓ Single-screen activation experience
- ✓ Immediate value delivery

   - Dismissible with single tap
   - Never block the interface
   - Maximum 8 words per tooltip

2. **Empty States with Guidance**
   - Patient list empty? Show "Your schedule will appear here"
   - No messages? Show "Team messages appear here"
   - Clear next action in every empty state

3. **Progressive Feature Discovery**
   - Unlock advanced features after basic proficiency
   - Celebrate milestones ("First visit documented! 🎉")
   - Suggest next steps based on usage patterns

**Visual Specifications**

- **Tooltip Style**:
  - Background: `#1A1A1A` with 95% opacity
  - Text: White, SF Pro Text Regular, 15px
  - Padding: 12px 16px

**First Action Prompt**: "View your loved one's recent care visits"

---

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### State Management

**Authentication State**

```typescript
interface AuthState {
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  user: User | null;
  biometricEnabled: boolean;
  sessionExpiry: Date | null;
  requiresReauth: boolean;
}
```

**Onboarding State**

```typescript
interface OnboardingState {
  isComplete: boolean;
  currentStep: 'activation' | 'biometric' | 'role' | 'complete';
  hasSeenTooltips: string[]; // IDs of dismissed tooltips
  firstVisitDocumented: boolean;
}
```

### Security Requirements

**Token Management**

- Access token: 1-hour expiry
- Refresh token: 30-day expiry, secure storage
- Biometric tokens: Device keychain only
- Automatic token refresh in background

**Data Protection**

- All auth data in device secure enclave
- No credentials stored in plain text
- Biometric data never leaves device
- Session tokens encrypted at rest

**Compliance**

- HIA (Health Information Act) compliant
- PIPEDA privacy standards
- SOC 2 Type II requirements
- Audit trail for all auth events

### Performance Targets

**Critical Metrics**

- App launch to biometric prompt: <500ms
- Biometric auth to patient list: <2 seconds total
- Activation flow completion: <60 seconds average
- First-time setup to first action: <90 seconds

**Optimization Strategies**

- Pre-load patient list during biometric auth
- Cache user role and permissions locally
- Lazy load non-critical features
- Progressive image loading for profile photos

### Offline Capabilities

**Offline Activation**

- Allow activation code entry offline
- Queue validation for when online
- Provide limited offline access during setup
- Clear communication about sync status

**Offline Authentication**

- Biometric works offline (device-level)
- Cached credentials for offline access
- Sync auth events when connection restored
- Offline session limit: 8 hours

## Animation & Motion Specifications

### Transition Timing

**Philosophy**: Animations should feel instant yet smooth. Nothing should feel sluggish.

**Timing Functions**

- **Ease-out**: Default for most transitions (feels responsive)
- **Spring**: For interactive elements (feels natural)
- **Linear**: For progress indicators only

**Duration Scale**

- **Instant**: 100ms - Feedback for taps
- **Quick**: 200-300ms - Screen transitions
- **Standard**: 400ms - Complex animations
- **Slow**: 600ms+ - Only for celebration moments

### Key Animations

**Success Checkmark**

```
Duration: 800ms total
  0-500ms: Draw checkmark path (ease-out)
  500-800ms: Scale bounce (spring, 1.0 → 1.2 → 1.0)
```

**Screen Transitions**

```
Duration: 400ms
  Outgoing: Fade to 0 opacity + scale to 0.95 (ease-out)
  Incoming: Fade from 0 + scale from 1.05 (ease-out)
  Overlap: 100ms (creates smooth crossfade)
```

**Button Press**

```
Duration: 100ms
  Press: Scale to 0.98 (ease-out)
  Release: Scale to 1.0 (spring)
  Haptic: Light impact on press
```

**Error Shake**

```
Duration: 400ms
  Translate X: 0 → -10 → 10 → -10 → 0 (ease-in-out)
  Cycles: 3
  Haptic: Error notification on start
```

### Haptic Feedback

**iOS Haptic Engine**

- **Light Impact**: Button taps, character entry
- **Medium Impact**: Successful actions
- **Heavy Impact**: Errors, important alerts
- **Success Notification**: Activation complete
- **Error Notification**: Invalid code, auth failure

**Android Vibration**

- **Short (10ms)**: Button taps
- **Medium (50ms)**: Successful actions
- **Pattern**: Errors (50ms, 100ms pause, 50ms)

---

## Design Rationale

### Why No Traditional Registration?

**Problem**: Traditional registration flows create friction and delay value delivery.

**Solution**: Pre-provisioned accounts mean users are expected and welcomed, not interrogated. The care coordinator handles administrative setup; the user just activates and starts working.

**Impact**: 60-second activation vs. 5-10 minute traditional registration.

### Why Biometric-First?

**Problem**: Passwords are forgotten, insecure, and slow to enter.

**Solution**: Biometric authentication is faster, more secure, and feels magical. It's the standard users expect from modern apps.

**Impact**: 2-second login vs. 15-30 second password entry.

### Why No Tutorial Carousel?

**Problem**: Users skip tutorials, then feel lost. Tutorials delay getting to actual work.

**Solution**: Contextual, just-in-time guidance appears exactly when needed. Empty states teach through use, not through reading.

**Impact**: Users start working immediately, learn by doing, retain knowledge better.

### Why Role Confirmation Screen?

**Problem**: Users need to understand what they can do and why.

**Solution**: Brief confirmation screen sets expectations and personalizes the experience. It's a moment of clarity, not a barrier.

**Impact**: Reduced confusion, fewer support tickets, better feature discovery.

## Developer Handoff Notes

### Implementation Priority

1. **P0 - Critical Path**: Activation flow, biometric setup, basic auth
2. **P1 - Core Experience**: Role confirmation, contextual tooltips, session management
3. **P2 - Polish**: Advanced animations, haptic feedback, edge case handling

### Key Integration Points

- **Backend API**: `/auth/activate`, `/auth/biometric/register`, `/auth/token/refresh`
- **Device APIs**: Biometric (Face ID/Touch ID/Fingerprint), Keychain/Keystore, Haptics
- **Analytics**: Track activation funnel, auth success rates, time-to-first-action
- **Error Logging**: Capture auth failures, activation errors, session issues

### Testing Scenarios

1. **Happy Path**: New user activates, enables biometric, starts working
2. **Biometric Unavailable**: User completes setup with passcode only
3. **Offline Activation**: User activates without network, syncs later
4. **Session Expiry**: User returns after 30 minutes, re-authenticates seamlessly
5. **Multiple Roles**: User with coordinator + caregiver roles sees appropriate experience
6. **Accessibility**: Complete flow with VoiceOver, large text, high contrast

### Performance Monitoring

- Track P95 latency for each screen transition
- Monitor biometric auth success/failure rates
- Alert on activation completion rate drops
- Dashboard for time-to-first-action metrics
